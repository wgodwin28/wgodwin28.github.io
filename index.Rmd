My name is Will Godwin. Professionally, I'm interested in research within the nexus of climate, health, and agriculture. I enjoy working with data, primarily in R, and am motivated to comprehensively visualize data before modeling and making distributional/statistical assumptions. [Rshiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) make that possible. I currently work as a Data Scientist at University of California San Francisco, managing and analyzing data from randomized-controlled trials investigating methods to reduce childhood mortality. Previously, I studied and worked in Seattle within a data science fellowship through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). While there, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health and spent 3 years modeling exposure and health burden due to environmental risk factors for the conspicuous [Global Burden of Disease](https://www.thelancet.com/gbd) study. The work at IHME was fast-paced and afforded me many crash courses in statistics, programming, and time management as we sought to carry out the institute's lofty [vision](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about).

Like all personal projects, this website is a work in progress and will be added to iteratively. It serves as a tool for my own growth in coding, statistics, and communicating analyses. Included are some data projects that focus on topics of interest to me including politics and the environment. As transparency and reproducibility become standard data science protocol, I use publicly available data and publish or direct readers to the underlying R code. I'll steadily add more small projects and analyses as I complete them.

In my free time, I love to go for bike rides out in the [Marin Headlands](images/hawk_hill.JPG) north of San Francisco.
