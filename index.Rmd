I'm Will Godwin and I'm a researcher interested in the nexus of climate, health, and agriculture. I currently work as a Research Analyst at University of California San Francisco, managing and analyzing data from randomized-controlled trials investigating methods to reduce childhood mortality. Previously, I studied and worked in Seattle within a fellowship through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. While there, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health and spent 3 years modeling the exposure and health burden due to environmental risk factors for the [Global Burden of Disease](https://www.thelancet.com/gbd) study. My MPH coursework and work experience at IHME was statistical in nature and allowed me to hone quantitative and programming capacities.
