My name is Will Godwin. Professionally, I'm interested in research within the nexus of climate, health, and agriculture. I currently work as a Research Analyst at University of California San Francisco, managing and analyzing data from randomized-controlled trials investigating methods to reduce childhood mortality. Previously, I studied and worked in Seattle within a fellowship through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. While there, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health and spent 3 years modeling exposure and health burden due to environmental risk factors for the [Global Burden of Disease](https://www.thelancet.com/gbd) study. My MPH coursework and work experience at IHME was statistical in nature and afforded me to hone quantitative and programming abilities. 

Like all personal projects, this website is a work in progress and will be added to iteratively. It serves as an tool for my own growth, in writing, coding, and statistics. Included are some data projects that touch on topics that interest me including politics and the environment. In the spirit of transparency and reproducibility I use publicly available data and publish or direct readers to underlying code. I've benefitted immensely from others publishing their code and methods and owe it to the amorphous R/stats community to do the same. I'll steadily add more small projects and analyses as I complete them.

When I'm not working, I love to go for bike rides out in the [Marin Headlands](images/hawk_hill.JPG) north of San Francisco.
