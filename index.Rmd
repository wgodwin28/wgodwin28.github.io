My name is Will Godwin. Professionally, I'm interested in research within the nexus of climate, health, and agriculture. I enjoy working with data, primarily in R, and am motivated to comprehensively visualize data before modeling and making distributional/statistical assumptions. [Rshiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) make that possible. I currently work as a Research Analyst at University of California San Francisco, managing and analyzing data from randomized-controlled trials investigating methods to reduce childhood mortality. Previously, I studied and worked in Seattle within a fellowship through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). While there, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health and spent 3 years modeling exposure and health burden due to environmental risk factors for the landmark [Global Burden of Disease](https://www.thelancet.com/gbd) study. The work at IHME was fast-paced and afforded me many crash courses in statistics, programming, and time management as we sought to carry out its lofty institutional [vision](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about).

Like all personal projects, this website is a work in progress and will be added to iteratively. It serves as a tool for my own growth in coding, statistics, and articulating analyses. Included are some data projects that focus on topics of interest to me including politics and the environment. In the spirit of transparency and reproducibility I use publicly available data and publish or direct readers to the underlying R code as I've benefitted immensely from members of the R/stats community publishing their code and explaining their methods. Plus, as a scientific principle, any researcher should strive for transparency and reproducibility when possible. I'll steadily add more small projects and analyses as I complete them.

When I'm not working, I love to go for bike rides out in the [Marin Headlands](images/hawk_hill.JPG) north of San Francisco.
